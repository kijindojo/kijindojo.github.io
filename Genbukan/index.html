                    <h1 lang="ja">Genbukan</h1>
                    <p>
                        The <span lang="ja">Genbukan</span> was established on November 28th, 1984 by <a href="/Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a>.
                        The name '<dfn title="the place that nurtures the martial art professionals" lang="ja">Genbukan</dfn>'
                        means the place that nurtures the martial art professionals (<dfn title="the place radiating with an exquisite martial art" lang="ja">Kuroto</dfn>): the place radiating with an exquisite martial art.
                        '<dfn lang="ja">Gen</dfn>' also means black - a place of practice for techniques
                        which are mysterious, strange and marvellous. The significance is that the one who
                        masters the <dfn lang="ja">Ninpo Bugei</dfn> gives light to the (outer) world of
                        darkness.

                    <h2>The Symbolism of the <span lang="ja">Genbukan</span> Emblem </h2>
                    <p>
                        <img src="/content/images/gbkpatch.gif" alt="Genbukan emblem" width="150" height="151" class="floatright">
                        The Buddist indomitable sacred wheel, the
                        eight-spoked <dfn lang="ja">Chakra (Horin)</dfn>, is the symbol of the <span lang="ja">
                            Genbukan
                        </span>. The Chakra was originally an ancient weapon of India, later
                        adopted for rituals in Tantric Buddhism. It symbolises the destruction of evil and
                        all that comes in the way of Dharma, which is the law and order of the universe.
                        In the centre is a sacred mirror manifesting the oneness of the divine spirit and
                        soul. With the character for perseverance 'Nin' is expressed the desire to attain
                        this oneness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Lotus petals, surrounding the mirror, signify that however 'muddy' the environment
                        is we keep our hearts pure and blossom out of the dirt and mire.
                        <br>
                        With sacred swords facing the eight cardinal directions evil cannot find its way
                        to cause harm against us. Believing that ultimately the martial way and the way
                        of Buddha is one and the same <a href="/Grandmaster">Grandmaster</a>
                        established this emblem for the Genbukan to emanate the infinite light of the noble
                        wheel.

                    <h2>Origins of the <dfn lang="ja">Genbukan</dfn> </h2>
                    <p>
                        The <dfn lang="ja">Genbukan</dfn> was created from many schools; some more than 1000
                        years old, by Grandmaster Tanemura, the present World Ninpo Bugei Federation President.
                        <dfn lang="ja">Genbukan</dfn> Ninpo is not limited to any one style (Ryu) the <dfn lang="ja">Genbukan</dfn> basics come from various Ryu ha, including:
                    </p>
                    <ul lang="ja">
                        <li>Togakure Ryu </li>
                        <li>Kumogakure Ryu </li>
                        <li>Kukishin Ryu </li>
                        <li>Gyokko Ryu </li>
                        <li>Gyokushin Ryu </li>
                        <li>Koto Ryu </li>
                        <li>Takagi Ryu </li>
                        <li>Gikan Ryu </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Within these Ryu you can find eighteen traditional topics of study, the "<span lang="ja">Bugei Juhappan</span>". There have been many different versions of the
                        <span lang="ja">bugei juhappan</span>, reflecting the differing needs of the time.
                        The following list has been suggested as a fairly stable core account.

                        These were the main subjects that a ninja had to master, but there were two that
                        remained as the most important: '<span lang="ja">Seishinteki Kyoyo</span>' (Spiritual
                        refinement), which involves the heart, spirit and soul; and Taijutsu (Unarmed defence),
                        involving the body and the physical techniques. Both combined produce miraculous
                        powers and gives the practitioner the '<span lang="ja">Shin Gi Tai Icchi</span>'
                        (Heart, technique and body combination).
