                        Laura Nakano started studying Judo at the age of 9, but decided that its sporting
                        nature detracted from its ability to be used for self-defence. When she was 15 years
                        old she was introduced to Ninjutsu as a complete self defence system and shortly
                        after joined Genbukan World Ninpo Bugei. She continued training as well as exploring
                        other martial arts such as Aikido and Kickboxing, which served to confirm her belief
                        that Genbukan Ninpo Taijutsu is the most comprehensive system and the best one for 
                        everybody to learn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In April 2004 she moved to Japan to study directly under Grandmaster Shoto Tanemura,
                        where she trained in Ninpo Taijutsu, Jujutsu, Bikenjutsu (sword techniques), Iaido, Bojutsu
                        (6ft &amp; 3ft staff techniques) and Chugoku Kempo (Chinese martial arts) among other
                        things.
                    </p>
                    <p>The title Dojo-Cho and Dojo name Kijin Dojo was given to Laura by Grandmaster Tanemura Sensei, so that she could establish a place to pass on her knowledge. She currently holds 4th Dan in Ninpo Taijutsu , 4th Dan in Jujitsu, Shoden Menkyo in Mugen Shintou Ryu amongst other grades .</p>
